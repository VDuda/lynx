**Managing secrets in AWS**

Applications and Systems often need access to some shared credential. For example, titan needs access to the mongo database password, or some API token to access a third party service. At the moment weâ€™re managing these secrets by storing them on a file. Using services like KMS and Dynamo we can create a centralized key store to manage secrets and keys without ever needing to persist the values on a machine.
