# Lynx

![LYNX](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Lynx_du_Canada_.jpg)

The lynx, has a prominent role in Greek, Norse, and North American mythology. It is considered an elusive and mysterious creature, known in some American Indian traditions as a 'keeper of secrets'. It is also believed to have supernatural eyesight, capable of seeing even through solid objects. As a result, it often symbolises the unravelling of hidden truths, and the psychic power of clairvoyance.


## Managing secrets in AWS

Applications and Systems often need access to some shared credential. For example, titan needs access to the mongo database password, or some API token to access a third party service. At the moment weâ€™re managing these secrets by storing them on a file. Using services like KMS and Dynamo we can create a centralized key store to manage secrets and keys without ever needing to persist the values on a machine.

Using services like KMS and Dynamo we can create a centralized key store to manage secrets and keys without ever needing to persist the values on a machine or s3. Each team can securely access the secret key store, view all the keys for the secrets (however, the secret itself will be encrypted), and to use the secret the team member will need the proper permissions set within their AWS IAM policy to decrypt a key. This effectively allows every product member to see the keys available, but only exposes the secret value to members who have permissions to view the secret value. Also, team leads will have permissions to create new keys. The secret values will be encrypted using the team's key.  

Lynx is effectively the architecture below, we've also created shell and Go interfaces to interact with Lynx. The interfaces allow the creation, decryption, listing, and deletion of keys.

### Terraform

```
terraform plan -var-file=lynx.tfvars
# Verify changes
terraform apply -var-file=lynx.tfvars
```

#### Dynamo

Placing an item into the table

```
aws dynamodb put-item --table-name lynx-kms --item "{ \"name\": {\"S\": \"mysql_root\"}, \"value\": {\"S\": \"Password123\"} }"
```

Looking up table values

```
aws dynamodb scan --table-name lynx-kms
```

#### AWS IAM

Within AWS IAM, each IAM role will need to attach the policy "Access-Lynx" to have the ability read the encrypted passwords from the key store. The policy allows access to the key store and the cmk. The policy is strictly set to allow read-only access.

#### Go Dependencies
We use Godep to manage Go packages and their dependencies.

```
go get github.com/tools/godep

# Check out listed dependency versions
godep restore

# List and copy dependencies into Godeps
godep save
```

#### Lynx sh interface
To access lynx from the shell, you can use the cli/lynxcli.sh to interact with the key store with your given aws credentials.

**NOTE:** Contact DevOps/Infra for AWS permissions. 

```
./cli/lynxcli.sh
```
**Menu options**
- 1 - Create Key/Pass
- 2 - Decrypt Key/Pass
- 3 - List all Keys
- 4 - Quit
